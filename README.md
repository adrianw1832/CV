## Adrian Wong

I am your typical recent Maths graduate who discovered coding whilst working in
a boring internship. I decided to join Maker's Academy to give it a go. I worked
really hard during my time there, not because I am Asian, but because I actually
thoroughly enjoyed it. Now, I want to continue my path to become a full stack developer
and work in an environment where I will constantly be learning.

## Skills

#### Logical Thinking

I have always been interested in problem solving and so that's why I went
on to do a bachelor's and postgraduate degree in Mathematics. I was invited to
sit the final round of the British Maths Olympiad in 2008 and 2009. I have also
been able to translate this to coding, as demonstrated in my Sudoku Challenge,
where I was able to implement an algorithm which solves any sudoku through
backtracking. I am used to breaking down and solving a complex problems because
that is a process I am already familiar with from Maths.

#### Communication

Right after Makers, I had the opportunity to work with Thoughtbot on a
week long design sprint and learnt that being a good developer does not
mean only being good at coding. I was a Kumon Maths tutor for 2 years
during which I developed the ability to explain complex concepts in a
simple manner. It also taught me to be patient and understand that
people think in various ways. That provided me different viewpoints on a
particular problem and taught me to tackle them in a new light. I
continued to develop this at Makers through pair programming and during
my time as an alumni helper after I graduated.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (07/2015 - 10/2015)

During my time at Makers, I was introduced to TDD and BDD. At first, they were
pretty weird and new concepts to me but I grew to appreciate them. Writing clean
and readable code was something that resonated with me because it reminded me of
the neat and elegant solutions you can have to a Maths problem. The standard
curriculum introduced us to Ruby, Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Rails and their
respective testings suites, but I also experimented with other technologies like
node, express, mongo, canvas and various other libraries. I started doing Upcase
right after I graduated and have since fallen in love with Vim.
